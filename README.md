# SDAL Builder

> **⚠️ WARNING: This is a new and experimental solution. The codebase is untested in production environments and under active development. Use at your own risk, and always validate output before deploying or integrating into other systems! Bug reports and test feedback are very welcome.**

**SDAL Builder** is an advanced, modular Python toolchain for building [SDAL Parcel Storage Format (PSF) v1.7](#sdal-parcel-storage-format-psf-v17) map archives from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data extracts.
It is designed for researchers, navigation developers, and simulation projects needing highly compressed, spatially indexed, verifiable map data—directly from OSM `.pbf` files.

## Data Flow (How it Works)

Below is a high-level walkthrough of what happens when you build an SDAL ISO:

| **Step**       | **What Happens**                                                                                | **Main Modules**                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1. Download    | OSM `.pbf` for the specified region is fetched from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/) | `main.py`                          |
| 2. ETL         | Roads, POIs, geometry, and attributes are extracted, cleaned, and normalized                    | `etl.py` / `sdal_osmium_stream.py` |
| 3. Encoding    | Roads, POIs, overlays are encoded into cartographic & navigational parcel families              | `encoder.py`, `constants.py`       |
| 4. Indexing    | 2-level KD-tree (spatial) and sparse B+-tree (OSM way ID → record offset) are constructed       | `spatial.py`                       |
| 5. Compression | Each parcel is compressed using Huffman coding, then CRC-32 checksums are computed              | `encoder.py`                       |
| 6. Packaging   | All data and indexes are packed into a single ISO image per SDAL PSF v1.7                       | `iso.py`                           |

**Visualization:**

```
[OSM .pbf]
   ↓
[ETL (roads, POIs)]
   ↓
[Parcel Encoding] —→ [KD-tree Index] —→
   ↓                  [B+-tree Index]     → [ISO Packaging + Compression] → [SDAL ISO]
[Cartographic/Navigation Parcels]
```

## Installation

**Requirements:**

* Python **3.9+**
* Basic build tools (for dependencies like numpy, shapely, pyrosm, pyosmium)

**Install Steps:**

```sh
# Clone and enter the project directory
git clone https://github.com/yourname/sdal_builder.git
cd sdal_builder

# Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* The [Osmium](https://osmcode.org/) library and Python bindings (`pyosmium`) are required for streaming mode.
  You may need to install system packages:

  * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libosmium2-dev`
  * macOS: `brew install osmium-tool`
  * Windows: see [pyosmium docs](https://docs.osmcode.org/pyosmium/latest/install.html)

---

## Usage

### 1. Building an SDAL ISO

**With the helper script:**

```sh
./build.sh <region> [region2 ...] [output.iso]
```

* Example:

  ```sh
  ./build.sh europe/cyprus
  ./build.sh europe/cyprus europe/spain my_maps.iso
  ```

**Direct Python (advanced/CI use):**

```sh
python sdal_build.py <region> [--out <output.iso>]
```

* Example:

  ```sh
  python sdal_build.py europe/germany --out germany.iso
  ```

* **Region names** use [Geofabrik region naming](https://download.geofabrik.de/).

### 2. Validating an SDAL ISO

After building, you can validate ISO file integrity:

```sh
python validate_sdal_iso.py my_maps.iso
```

---

## Choosing the OSM Processing Engine

* **Default behavior:**
  The builder uses Pyrosm for small/medium regions and automatically switches to Osmium streaming for large `.osm.pbf` files to reduce memory usage.
* **Manual selection:**
  If you want to explicitly choose the engine (if implemented in your CLI):

  * To force Osmium streaming (recommended for files over \~2GB):

    ```sh
    python sdal_build.py <region> --engine osmium
    ```
  * To use Pyrosm (default):

    ```sh
    python sdal_build.py <region> --engine pyrosm
    ```
* If these flags are not available, engine selection is automatic based on file size.

## Burning SDAL ISO Images

To ensure maximum compatibility, always use a reliable ISO writing tool and avoid using "quick burn" or "multi-session" options.

**Recommended steps:**

1. **On Linux/macOS:**
   Use `dd` (replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB/SD/DVD device, and double-check your target!):

   ```sh
   sudo dd if=your_output.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync
   ```

2. **On Windows:**
   Use a trusted tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and select the "ISO image mode" (not "ISOHybrid" or other custom formats).
   Be sure to fully erase/re-format your target media before burning.

3. **General recommendations:**

   * Always safely eject the device after writing.
   * Do not use tools that "modify" the ISO or add extra boot sectors unless specifically required.
   * Test the media on the intended target system before deployment.

> **Compatibility Note:**
> SDAL ISOs created by this project follow the SDAL PSF v1.7 spec, but downstream system compatibility may depend on SDAL implementation details, media quality, and burn method. If you encounter issues, try a different burning tool or medium.

## Cleaning Up

To remove temporary files, caches, and build artifacts:

```sh
./build.sh --clean
```

This will:

* Remove Python bytecode caches
* Remove `.venv` (virtual environment)
* Remove build directories and `.iso` files

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which regions are available?**
A: Use any region or subregion supported by Geofabrik (see [list here](https://download.geofabrik.de/index-v1.json)). Example: `europe/cyprus`, `europe/germany`.

**Q: Does this generate DENSO* files?*\*
A: No, this project outputs SDAL-compliant ISO archives only. (If DENSO compatibility is added later, document here.)

**Q: Can I use my own OSM .pbf file?**
A: Yes. Place your `.osm.pbf` in `build/tmp` and specify the file via CLI if needed.

**Q: Does this include turn-by-turn routing?**
A: No. While the navigational topology is included for routing engines, actual routing or navigation is not implemented.

**Q: My machine runs out of memory on large OSM files!**
A: Use the Osmium streaming mode for processing. It minimizes memory usage and provides progress updates.

## SDAL Parcel Storage Format (PSF) v1.7

This project builds archives strictly according to the [SDAL PSF v1.7 specification](https://example.com/sdal-psf-spec):

* **Cartographic and Navigable Parcels:**
  Store road geometry, topology, and names in binary "families" for efficient loading.
* **Spatial Indexing:**
  Two-level KD-tree enables fast spatial lookups for any geometry.
* **OSM Way Indexing:**
  Sparse B+-tree provides byte-level addressability of any original OSM way.
* **Per-parcel Compression and CRC:**
  Each parcel is Huffman-compressed and verified with a CRC32 checksum.
* **ISO Image Packaging:**
  All parcels, indexes, and metadata are written to a single SDAL ISO image.
